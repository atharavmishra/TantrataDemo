A brief what this application does:- This application searches for top viral images of the week from the Imgur gallery and displays them in a grid and it also 
allows user to search their query, user can change the layout from grid to list and vice versa.Each post/image has its own layout with some information like date 
and time of post, number of images with that post and title of the image.
